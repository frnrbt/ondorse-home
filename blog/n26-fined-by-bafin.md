##### An Always More Stringent Regulator Scrutiny

BaFin had already ordered the German payments company to strengthen its money-laundering prevention in 2019.  Following last year's collapse of payments firm Wirecard, BaFin had extended earlier this year its oversight of N26 to cover the whole company and in May 2021, BaFin had already ordered N26 to put in place internal controls and safeguards to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.  At that time, in a quite unusual move, BaFin also installed a special supervisor to monitor the bank. 

The fine comes one day after Germany’s largest online bank, ING Germany, was criticised in court by a BaFin representative for its slow response to suspicious trades by a client, who later admitted to large-scale insider trading.

##### Customer Due Diligence at the Core of AML Deficiencies

In a statement, N26 said that this fine related to the late filing of close to 50 suspicious activity reports in 2019 and 2020.  In May 2021, BaFin urged the lender to “rectify deficiencies both in IT monitoring and in customer due diligence” and to “ensure that it has the adequate personnel, technical and organisational resources to comply with its obligations under anti-money laundering law”. N26 said it has taken “numerous detailed measures” to strengthen its anti-financial crime controls.

At Ondorse, we think that innovative financial actors should implement effective compliance controls and mechanisms at the very beginning of their operations, to show regulators goodwill and how seriously financial crime is taken. Just like N26 which quickly grew to more than 7 million clients in 25 countries, Ondorse can help you quickly scale account opening by automating documentary and non-documentary requirements.
