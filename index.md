      - question: What checks does Ondorse conduct?
        answer: >
          Ondorse’s set of customizable checks allows you to answer the
          following four questions:


          *   Is this a real business?


          *   Will this business defraud us?


          *   Is this actually that real business?


          *   Can we legally do business with them?
        type: faq_item
      - answer: >
          While Ondorse was originally designed for financial companies,
          including crypto platforms, we are now partnering with marketplaces
          and platforms willing to verify their new or existing SME vendors.

        question: Who does Ondorse work with?
      - question: 'How does Ondorse replace the process of KYB/KYC refresh? '
        answer: >
          Ondorse automatically populates your back office tool with the most
          up-to-date evaluations, compulsory documents and company information
          on the corporate customers you are engaged with.
      - question: How can Ondorse detect shell companies?
        answer: >
          Ondorse continuously monitors events affecting the KYB of your users
          and pushes you notifications in case of important corporate
          information updates, such as a UBO, shareholder or legal
          representative change.
      - question: How can Ondorse help stay on top of asset freeze obligations?
        answer: >
          Ondorse pushes you alerts in case of a true asset freeze match
          involving a connection (UBO, shareholder or legal representative)
          associated with one of your customers. With our screening tool fed
          with permanently refreshed company information, you immediately know
          if one of your users is subject to direct or indirect AML-CFT risk.
